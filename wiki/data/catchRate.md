This dataset provides the catch rate for each Pokémon. The catch rate is a
statistic that determines how easy it is to catch a Pokémon. The higher the
catch rate, the easier it is to catch the Pokémon. In the context of Pokémon Legends: Arceus,
many Pokémon were given heightened catch rates to make catching them outside of battle much easier.
