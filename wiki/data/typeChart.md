This dataset provides detailed effectiveness values for attacks between different Pokémon types.
It lists the effectiveness of an attacking type against a defending type, with numerical values indicating the level of effectiveness:
- **0** denotes immunity (no effect)
- **0.5** means the attack is not very effective (half damage)
- **1** means the attack is effective (regular damage)
- **2** means the attack is very effective (double damage)
- `Attacking` (`factor`): The Pokémon type of the attacking move.
- `Defending` (`factor`): The Pokémon type of the defending Pokémon.
- `Effectiveness` (`numeric`): The multiplier for the effectiveness of the attack.
