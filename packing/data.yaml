        The National PokeDex is a comprehensive database that records information on all Pokémon known to exist,
        instead of just ones native in a particular region.
        This dataset provides information about Pokémon as per the National Pokédex,
        which includes Pokémon from the Kanto region first, followed by those from Johto,
        Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, Galar, Hisui, and Paldea.

    description: |
        This dataset contains information about Legendary and Mythical Pokémon,
        which are a special group of Pokémon that are incredibly rare and often very powerful.
        These Pokémon are categorized by their family groupings and sizes.
        Family groupings are often based on common themes or characteristics among the Pokémon.
        
        For example, the 'Tao trio' refers to Reshiram, Zekrom, and Kyurem,
        which are associated with the concept of yin, yang, and wuji.
        
        The 'Super-ancient Pokémon' refers to Kyogre, Groudon, and Rayquaza,
        which are ancient Pokémon with powerful weather abilities.
        
        The 'Paradox duo' refers to Koraidon and Miraidon, which are associated with different timelines.

    name: Pokémon Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion
    description: |
        This dataset contains information about Pokémon that can undergo Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion,
        which are special forms of evolution that Pokémon can undergo during battle to become more powerful.
        These Pokémon are categorized by their National Pokédex number, name, type before and after evolution, ability before and after evolution, and the stone required for the evolution.
        
        For example, ‘Rayquaza’ is a Dragon/Flying type Pokémon with the ability ‘Air Lock’ that can undergo
        Mega Evolution to remain a Dragon/Flying type but with the ability ‘Delta Stream’. Unlike other Pokémon,
        Rayquaza does not require a Mega Stone to undergo Mega Evolution. Instead, Rayquaza must swallow the
        Meteorite and learn Dragon Ascent during the Delta Episode or must be taught Dragon Ascent via move tutor.
        
        The 'Primal Reversion' refers to Kyogre and Groudon,
        which are ancient Pokémon that revert to their primal forms with the Blue Orb and Red Orb respectively,
        changing their abilities to 'Primordial Sea' and 'Desolate Land'.
        
        Note that there exist Primal Dialga, hovever this appears to be different from Primal Reversion.
