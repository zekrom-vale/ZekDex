\description{
This dataset provides detailed effectiveness values for attacks between different Pokémon types.
It lists the effectiveness of an attacking type against a defending type, with numerical values indicating the level of effectiveness:
\itemize{
\item \strong{0} denotes immunity (no effect)
\item \strong{0.5} means the attack is not very effective (half damage)
\item \strong{1} means the attack is effective (regular damage)
\item \strong{2} means the attack is very effective (double damage)
}
