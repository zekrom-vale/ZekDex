\description{
This dataset outlines the effectiveness of various attacking Pokémon types against defending types.
Each cell in the dataset represents the effectiveness multiplier when a Pokémon type attacks another.
The effectiveness is represented by numerical values:
\itemize{
\item \strong{0} denotes immunity (the attack has no effect)
\item \strong{0.5} means the attack is not very effective (half damage)
\item \strong{1} means the attack is effective (causes regular damage)
\item \strong{2} means the attack is very effective (causes double damage)
}
