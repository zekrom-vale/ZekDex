#' Pokémon Type Effectiveness Dataset
#'
#' This dataset provides a matrix of effectiveness multipliers for different types of Pokémon attacks.
#' Each Pokémon has a type, such as Fire, Water, Grass, etc., and each type has different effectiveness against other types.
#' This effectiveness is represented by a multiplier that is applied to the attack's damage.
#' 
#' The dataset is structured as a wide format, with each column representing a defending Pokémon's type and
#' each row representing an attacking Pokémon's type.
#' @format A data frame with 19 variables (1 for the attacking type and 18 for each defending type):
#' \describe{
#'	\item{Attacking}{`factor` The type of the attacking Pokémon's move. There are 18 types in total.}
#'	\item{Defending_*}{`numeric` The effectiveness of the attacking type against the defending type. This is represented by a multiplier (0, 0.5, 1, 2) applied to the attack's damage. Each 'Defending_*' represents a different Pokémon type.}

#'	\item{Effectiveness}{`numeric` The multiplier for the effectiveness of the attack. It lists the effectiveness of an attacking type against a defending type, with numerical values indicating the level of effectiveness: 0 denotes immunity (no effect), 0.5 means the attack is not very effective (half damage), 1 means the attack is effective (regular damage), and 2 means the attack is very effective (double damage).}
