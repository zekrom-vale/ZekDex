#' Pokemon Damage Calculation Generation V and onward
#'
#' This function calculates the damage inflicted during a Pokemon battle.
#' It uses the formula from Generation V and onward. This formula takes into
#' account various factors such as the level of the attacking Pokemon, its
#' attack stat, the defense stat of the target Pokemon, the power of the move
#' used, and more.
#'
#' @note
#' this function does not handle the specific conditions mentioned (like
#' Reflect, Light Screen, Explosion, Selfdestruct, etc.). You would need to
#' handle these conditions before passing the values to this function. This
#' means that if any of these conditions are present in the battle scenario,
#' they should be accounted for before using this function.
#'
#' @param level The level of the attacking Pokemon. This is an integer value
#' representing the current level of the Pokemon performing the attack.
#' @param attackStat The effective Attack stat of the attacking Pokemon. This
#' is a numeric value representing the attacking Pokemon's Attack or Special
#' Attack stat, depending on whether the move being used is a physical or
#' special move.
#' @param defenseStat The effective Defense stat of the target Pokemon. This
#' is a numeric value representing the target Pokemon's Defense or Special
#' Defense stat, depending on whether the move being used is a physical or
#' special move.
#' @param power The power of the used move. This is a numeric value
#' representing the base power of the move being used by the attacking Pokemon.
#' @param effectiveness The product of Type1 and Type2. This is a numeric
#' value representing the combined type effectiveness of the move against the
#' target Pokemon. This takes into account the type of the move and the
#' type(s) of the target Pokemon.
#' @param stab Logical. If TRUE, add the same type attack bonus. This is a
#' boolean value indicating whether the move being used is of the same type as
#' the attacking Pokemon. If TRUE, a Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) is applied,
#' increasing the damage dealt.
#' @param PB Logical. If TRUE, the move is the second strike of Parental Bond.
#' Default is FALSE. This is a boolean value indicating whether the move is
#' the second strike of a move affected by the Parental Bond Ability. If TRUE,
#' the damage of the move is adjusted accordingly.
#' @param weather Numeric. Weather is 1.5 if a Water-type move is being used
#' during rain or a Fire-type move or Hydro Steam during harsh sunlight, and
#' 0.5 if a Water-type move (besides Hydro Steam) is used during harsh
#' sunlight or a Fire-type move during rain, or SolarBeam during any non-clear
#' weather besides harsh sunlight, and 1 otherwise or if any Pokemon on the
#' field have the Ability Cloud Nine or Air Lock. Default is 1. This is a
#' numeric value representing the effect of the current weather conditions on
#' the move. Certain weather conditions can increase or decrease the damage of
#' certain types of moves.
#' @param GlaiveRush Logical. If TRUE, the target used the move Glaive Rush in
#' the previous turn. Default is FALSE. This is a boolean value indicating
#' whether the target Pokemon used the move Glaive Rush in the previous turn.
#' If TRUE, the damage of the move is adjusted accordingly.
#' @param critical Logical. If TRUE, it's a critical hit. Default is FALSE.
#' This is a boolean value indicating whether the move landed a critical hit.
#' If TRUE, the damage of the move is increased.
#' @param burn Logical. If TRUE, the attacker is burned, its Ability is not
#' Guts, and the used move is a physical move. Default is FALSE. This is a
#' boolean value indicating whether the attacking Pokemon is burned. If TRUE
#' and the attacking Pokemon's Ability is not Guts and the move is a physical
#' move, the damage of the move is reduced.
#' @param other Numeric. Other is 1 in most cases, and a different multiplier
#' when specific interactions of moves, Abilities, or items take effect.
#' Default is 1. This is a numeric value representing other potential
#' modifiers to the damage calculation. These can include things like held
#' items, Abilities, and other effects.
#' @param ZMove Logical. If TRUE, the move is a Z-Move or Max Move and the
#' target would be protected from that move (e.g. by Protect). Default is
#' FALSE. This is a boolean value indicating whether the move is a Z-Move or
#' Max Move. If TRUE and the target would be protected from the move (e.g. by
#' the move Protect), the damage of the move is adjusted accordingly.
#' @param TeraShield Logical. If TRUE, it is applied in Tera Raid Battles when
#' the Raid boss's shield is active. Default is FALSE. This is a boolean value
#' indicating whether a TeraShield is active in a Tera Raid Battle. If TRUE,
#' the damage of the move is adjusted accordingly.
#' @param targets Numeric. Targets is 0.75 (0.5 in Battle Royals) if the move
#' has more than one target when the move is executed, and 1 otherwise.
#' Default is 1. This is a numeric value representing the number of targets of
#' the move. If the move targets multiple Pokemon, the damage of the move is
#' adjusted accordingly.
#' @param random Character string. If "yes", a random uniformly distributed
#' integer between 85 and 100 is used. If "minmax", the min and max values are
#' returned. If anything else, the average is used. Default is "yes". This is
#' a character string indicating how to handle randomness in the damage
#' calculation. If set to "yes", a random integer between 85 and 100 is used.
#' If set to "minmax", the minimum and maximum possible values are returned.
#' If set to anything else, the average value is used.
#' @param .criticalVal Numeric. The critical hit multiplier. Default is 1.5
#' (2 in Generation V). This is a numeric value representing the multiplier
#' applied to the damage when a critical hit lands. The default value is 1.5,
#' but it was 2 in Generation V.
#' @param .PBVal Numeric. The Parental Bond multiplier. Default is 0.25 (0.5
#' in Generation VI). This is a numeric value representing the multiplier
#' applied to the damage when the move is the second strike of a move affected
#' by the Parental Bond Ability. The default value is 0.25, but it was 0.5 in
#' Generation VI.
#'
#' @return The calculated damage. This function returns a numeric value
#' representing the calculated damage dealt by the attacking Pokemon to the
#' target Pokemon, based on the provided parameters and the Generation V
#' damage formula.

#' Pokemon Damage Calculation Random
#'
#' This function calculates the random factor in Pokemon damage calculation.
#' Gen I-II uses `.min = 217, .max = 255`, while Gen III+ uses `.min = 85, .max = 100`
#'
#' @param random How to generate the random number.
#' @param .min The min random number to generate to be divided by `.max`.
#' @param .max The max random number to generate to be divided by `.max`.
#'
#' @return The random factor.
#' @importFrom stats runif
